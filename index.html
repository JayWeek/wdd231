                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p class="about-me-text">My foundation for character and resilience is deeply rooted in the wisdom and guidance I receive from a higher power, whose influence has significantly shaped my perspective on life's complexities and challenges. Anchored in these spiritual teachings, I am committed to integrating divine principles into every facet of my personal and professional journey. As an engaged student at BYU Idaho Pathway Connect, I'm not only honing technical skills but also laying the groundwork to make meaningful contributions within specialized fields such as DevOps, cloud computing services, or network architecture—domains that hold the potential for transforming industries and improving lives.

    Outside the structured realm of academics, my downtime is a sacred space where I engage in scripture study. This practice not only offers comfort and direction but serves as an essential compass guiding me to navigate through life's trials with grace and integrity. Moreover, I find joy and relaxation in playing video games, an activity that does more than simply entertain—it allows for moments of peace amidst the hustle of daily routines, while simultaneously fostering my capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving.

    The synthesis of these elements—spiritual reflection, academic pursuit, and leisure time activities like gaming—contributes to a holistic personal development. It is this balanced approach that nurtures my growth both as an individual and as someone striving to honor my beliefs in all aspects of life. My ultimate aspiration is to apply the principles instilled through my faith and education to make a difference within the technology sector, working towards creating solutions that are not only innovative but also serve humanity with integrity and purpose.

    In essence, I view each day as an opportunity to integrate these diverse interests into a cohesive tapestry of life—a life where learning, faith, and play intersect to foster resilience, creativity, and above all, alignment with the values that truly matter.</p>
